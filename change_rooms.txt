You feel a slight breeze, tickeling thy genetails.
You heard a sound. What might that have been?
You see no more light, comming from the cracks in the ceiling. How far down have you gone?
You can hear a quiet Saxophone in the distand. What the hell?
You found a treasure chest. In it there is a letter which reads: "First!". You are confused.
You find a lot of empty bottles and it reeks of alcohol. This must have been one hell of a party.
"Go on, investigate that cave", they said. "It will be fun." they said.
