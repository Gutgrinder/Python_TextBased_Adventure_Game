Thats not a direction, you know?
Still not a direction.
Nah man, wrong input.
Are you doing that on purpose?
Doesn't seem like you like to move it move it, eh?
Do you even type, brah? Apparently not.
There are actually pretty good aid organizations, which could help you with your ability to NOT type.
Or maybe you are blind? Might be, because the directions you have to enter, are displayed. (north/east/south/west) Just pick one.
